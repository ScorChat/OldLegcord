# OldLegcord

OldLegcord is an experimental Legcord fork that connects to Oldcord instead of Discord while an actual Discord client reimplementation is being developed.

## Differences from Legcord

- No client mods: Only Oldplunger is allowed
- No Themes Support: Oldplunger will be handling themes
